# Chronos Timeline
A web application that allows you to visualize time events graphically.

## Problem
Events and people in history are interrelated. When studying them, it's hard to understand connected or concurrent events by looking up dates and trying to put them together in your head.

## Goal
To provide a visual representation of historical of events, in a way that makes it easier to see how they relate in a timeline.

## Objectives
* Build a web site that allows users to enter historical events (discrete or ranges).
* Practice building a simple but complete solution using full stack development.
* Make app available on the public internet.

## Requirements
* The system must allow tracking of discrete events as a date plus a label
* The system must allow tracking of time spans as two dates plus a label
* The system should allow an arbitrary number of labels to be associated with each event
* The system should allow the user to select an arbitrary number of events to display along a timeline
* The system must be accessible using a web browser
* The system must be built using modern front end technologies such as Node.js/Mongodb/React.
* The system should use TDD.
* The system should be deployed on the public internet.
