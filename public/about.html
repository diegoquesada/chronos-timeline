  <h1>About Chronos</h1>
  <p>Chronos is a web application designed to help visualize historical events graphically.
    
    Historical events are interrelated. They are brought upon most often by people, and in turn
    they impact people's lives. When studying both, it's hard to understand connected or concurrent
    events by looking up dates and trying to put them together in your head.
    
    Chronos is meant to assist in our understanding of historical events, by providing a visual
    representation along a timeline. Filters can be applied by using date ranges, people's names,
    and a variety of tags.
